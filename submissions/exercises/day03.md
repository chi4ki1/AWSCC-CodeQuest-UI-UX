## Hello there, my fellow Alfbuddy! ðŸ’–

You've made itâ€”great job! Now, here's the scoop: this markdown file is your **canvas**. Customize it; let your creativity flow!

Remember, you're free to add your personal touch, but keep the sacred requirements intact; they are the guardians of order here. This markdown file should or may include:
- Link to your own file of **"Week 1 [Day 3] : Activity"**</br>
ðŸš€https://www.figma.com/file/TCZAyCkRgZgiJ0FV3yA9gQ/Week-1-%5BDay-3%5D-%3A-Activity-(Community)?type=design&node-id=202-37&mode=design&t=Qtfp9RM9JiCWday0-0 </br>
- An **optional** screenshot of playing the game **"Can't Unsee"** and your feedback</br>
ðŸš€ After playing this fun game, I realized that I still need to improve my skill when it comes to attention to detail at some aspects in graphics. Although, I won't be uploading a screenshot of the game, I was labeled as "beginner" which is pretty reasonable as I am still about to dive into improving my creativity skills. It was honestly fun that there are little details that I didn't know existed that could affect the overall performance and aesthetics of the work/design. </br>
Ready to include your output for **Day 3**? Let the customization begin! ðŸš€âœ¨
