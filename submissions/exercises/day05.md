âœ¦ One step ahead in becoming literate in using Figma, I have undoubtedly acquired extensive knowledge in employing various tools, elevating my proficiency to a whole new level.  Although, it was overwhelming at first seeing a lot of information that I could learn from, I can say that It was intimidating to get to it at first but I figured out that performing the interactive tutorials in the figma layouts was fun and I effectively learned the concepts.
